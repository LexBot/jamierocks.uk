    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Once again, Spigot will be exhibiting at Minecon. It was <a href="http://www.spigotmc.org/threads/spigotmc-is-exhibiting-at-minecon-2015.68872/" target="_blank" rel="external">announced</a> last saturday, just 35 days before the event.<br>This is be the second time they have exhibited at Minecon, as they also exhibited last Minecon (2013).</p>
<p>However exhibiting isn’t cheap, and I ask you (if you can) to <a href="http://www.spigotmc.org/#donate" target="_blank" rel="external">donate</a> to them.<br>Throughout the past months, Spigot has kept Bukkit servers up to date and still running, even if they have done it in ways disliked by many of the community…</p>
<p>If you would like to find more information about Spigot’s exhibition, see their <a href="http://www.spigotmc.org/threads/minecon-2015-exhibition-info.69644/" target="_blank" rel="external">post</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not very long ago Lapitar was deprecated in favour of Visage.<br><img src="https://visage.gameminers.com/full/512/3923ded05a0b4dadba834d870cb3e328.png" alt="Me"><br>Visage is not only a successor to Lapitar, it is also a lot better than Lapitar.<br>This is because of better code, and Visage is backed by better servers.</p>
<p>Visage like most other avatar services, comes with a variety of different modes. Visage is no exception!</p>
<p>Firstly there is face. Face is a very simple 2D face view.<br>Next there is head. Head is a perspective 3D head view.<br>There is also bust. Bust is a 3D bust view of the player.<br>You also have full. Full is a full 3D view of the player.<br>Lastly you have skin. Skin is… the skin.</p>
<p>Visage is the best skin service I have used, and I strongly recommend you <a href="https://visage.gameminers.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">check</a> it out.</p>

<p>The stream should be available on <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/SpongePoweredMC" target="_blank" rel="external">twitch.tv/SpongePoweredMC</a>, however it is recommended you follow them on <a href="https://twitter.com/spongepowered" target="_blank" rel="external">Twitter</a> in case this changes.<br>Permitting the server isn’t as unstable as last time, I will be on there enjoying whatever the Sponge team has created.</p>
